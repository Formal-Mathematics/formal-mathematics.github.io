# Getting Started

To participate in this course, you will need: 

1. A computer with [`elan`](https://github.com/leanprover/elan) and [`vscode`](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed; you must also install the [`Lean4` package](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=leanprover.lean4) for `vscode`.
2. A [github](https://github.com/) account, preferably with an [`ssh` key set up](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

# The natural number game

To start off, please look at the [natural number game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/hhu-adam/NNG4), and complete as much as you can. 
Try to finish the first few worlds at least.
This game is an excellent beginner-friendly introduction to the mechanics of interactive theorem proving in Lean4.

**Note:** Proving theorems is just a part of this course. Arguably another interesting aspect of formal mathematics is writing *definitions*. This course will cover both.
